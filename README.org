The structure of this configuration is substantially derived from the excellent work defined in [[https://github.com/gefjon/stumpwm-init.git][Phoebe's super sexy stumpwm config]] ... it had not previously occured to me to use asdf's support for package inferred systems to organize a stump configuration, but having read Phoebe's config, I could immediately see that the effect was salubrious. This organisation should immediately reveal how to extend itself to the user. Should you have any questions, feel free to file an issue on this repository at github, and I will do my best to ameliorate the problem.

Phoebe uses xsetroot to handle setting the background (wallpaper) image. In my use this is not sufficient, because I have a large collection of thematically sorted, wallpaper quality images, so I have included a small function and a command/keybind for setting the background. The image source pathing assumes that the directory $HOME/Desktop_pics/<image_directories> exists, but you can override this in theme.lisp. This hardcoding should be made configurable, but I have not done it yet. When I do, I will remove this note.
